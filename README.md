# CNIC-Fraud-Detection

All the `.py` files use the two images in the images/ folder:
- image1.jpg
- image2.jpeg

There are three files as of now, all the files are different algorithms of comparing images:
- cosineComparing.py --> uses cosineSimilarity
- MSEComparing.py --> uses MSE
- SSIMComparing.py --> uses SSIM

Best so far, the algorithm which shows the maximum difference is `MSE`.
